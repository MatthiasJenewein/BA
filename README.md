# Extension README

Message from the author: Matthias Jenewein

This is the repository for the small written extension.

Prerequisties: 
  - Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot extension
  - Node.js (at least v14)
  - Signed in to GitHub with an active GitHub Copilot subscription

As soon as you cloned the project (and its open in VS Code) run npm install to pull all necessary libraries. Afterwards press F5, this will open another (actually functional) project. 
In this new project, you can then press Ctrl + Shift + P. This opens the toolbar in the top middle of the screen, there you can select the prompting strategy. 
After selecting the prompting strategy, the GitHub Copilot Chat will be opened automatically and the prompt will be copied in there.
