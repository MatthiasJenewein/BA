# ba-prompt-engineering README

This is the repository for the small written extension.

To use it, you need a GitHub Copilot account.

As soon as you cloned the project, open it in VS Code and press F5, this will open another (actually functional) project. 
In this new project, you can then press Ctrl + Shift + P. This opens the toolbar in the top middle of the screen, there you can select the prompting strategy. 
After selecting the prompting strategy, the GitHub Copilot Chat will be opened automatically and the prompt will be copied in there.
